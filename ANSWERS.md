Question 1 Ans. 
    	PropTypes makes sure the right type of props is passed to a component. PropTypes define type and which props are required. This helps you and future developers because you can open a component and see which props are required and what type they should be. It gives you the ability to catch more bugs when your data is organized and laid out in a certain way.

Question 2 Ans.
        The react life-cycle events is composed of three Phases for a component. First phase is the mounting phase. This phase is when a component is being built out. Your initial data will be defined on the constructor of this phase and the render method is invoked. Phase two is the updating phase. State data can be changed with setState forcing a render. Phase three is the Un-mounting phase. The component is removed from the screen, where componentWillUnmount can be used.

Question 3 Ans.
     	A Higher-order component is an advanced react technique for reusing component logic. HOC is a pattern that emerges when using react. A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns another component.   

Question 4 Ans.
	Three different ways to style components in react is, Inline CSS, Styles components and Less. 
    
    Inline CSS directly affects the tag they are written in without the use of selectors. This type goes inside the elements beginning tag right after the tag name. 
    
    Styles components allow you to use encapsulated styles throughout your code base, instead of styling HTML elements or components based on their class. The styles become a part of their component. 
    
    Less is a preprocessor style sheet that can be compiled into CSS. It allows you to use variables, mixins, operations and functions.
